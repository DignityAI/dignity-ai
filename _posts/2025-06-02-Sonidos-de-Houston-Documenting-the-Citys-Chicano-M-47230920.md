Sonidos de Houston: Documenting the City&rsquo;s Chicano Music Scene is a research and publication initiative supported by a 2022 American Folklife Center Community Collections Grant, an institutional grant program of the Mellon Foundation, NY. Over the course of a year, a documentary team recorded musical performances and conducted interviews with several generations of musicians to illustrate the deep roots and contemporary manifestations of Chicano musical traditions that have long flourished in and around the city of Houston, Texas. The collection includes 12 digital video recordings, 35 audio files, 46 still images, and several dozen manuscript and graphic items, including interview transcripts, that document the creative expressions and historical experiences of pioneers of Chicano music and the emerging generations of artists in Texas&rsquo;s Gulf Coast.
