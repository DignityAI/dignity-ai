Photographs of dance and dancing are vital visual documentation of dance practices and performance in the United States. This digital collection represents the entire contents of the Music Division&rsquo;s collection of Larry Colwell Dance Photographs. In studio portraits, Colwell captured many ballet stars of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and the New York City Ballet. He also developed a technique for photographing live dance whose aesthetic used blurring to connote the excitement of seeing the moving dancer.
