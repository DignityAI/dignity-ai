The Blackwell Family Papers span the years 1759-1960, with the bulk of the material dating from 1845 to 1890. Consisting of approximately 29,000 items (58,002 images), most of which were digitized from 76 reels of microfilm, the collection predominantly represents two generations of the Blackwell family and twenty individual family members. Nearly two centuries of the family&rsquo;s daily lives are documented in correspondence, diaries, speeches, and other papers, exemplifying the family&rsquo;s long commitment to social reform movements, such as abolition; women&rsquo;s rights, including the right to equal education; women&rsquo;s suffrage; and temperance.
