The papers of United States and Confederate army officer, lawyer, and Virginia state legislator Jubal Anderson Early (1816-1894) consist of 5,000 items (5,368 images) in 18 containers. Spanning the years 1829-1930, the bulk of which were created after the Civil War, the collection includes correspondence, diaries, military papers, speeches and articles, clippings, a scrapbook, printed matter, and maps relating to his military, legal, and political careers. Material created prior to the Civil War reflects Early's years as a cadet at the United States Military Academy, his army service, law practice, and Virginia political activities. Papers relating to Early's experiences during the Civil War include items concerning his participation in the battles of First Bull Run and Williamsburg, the Gettysburg Campaign, and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864. The collection also contains a report on the performance of General Isaac Trimble's brigade in the Battle of Second Bull Run, reports by generals Harry T. Hays and Clement A. Evans on skirmishes in the Mine Run Campaign, a list of units in G. T. Beauregard's I Corps, Army of Northern Virginia (1862), and a return of troops commanded by Joseph E. Johnston in the spring of 1862. Postwar material documents Early's exile outside of the United States, business affairs, especially the Louisiana lottery, his activities at the Southern Historical Society, and aid extended to Confederate families, including that of Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson.
