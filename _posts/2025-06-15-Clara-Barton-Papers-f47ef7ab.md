The papers of nurse, educator, philanthropist, and lecturer Clara Barton (1821-1912) consist of 62,000 items (81,608 images), most of which were digitized from 123 reels of previously produced microfilm. Spanning the years 1805-1958, with the bulk dating from 1861 to 1912, the collection contains correspondence, diaries and journals, reports, addresses, legal and financial papers, organizational records, lectures, writings, scrapbooks, biographical material, printed matter, memorabilia, and other papers. They relate primarily to Barton's work providing relief services during the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War in Europe, her founding in 1881 and subsequent leadership of the American National Red Cross, and her establishment in 1905 of the National First Aid Association of America. In addition to her roles as "Angel of the Battlefield" and Red Cross founder, the papers also reflect to a lesser degree Barton's work as a teacher in Massachusetts and later at one of the first public schools in New Jersey, as a government clerk and one of the first female federal employees, as the director of a woman's prison, and as an advocate for women's suffrage and other progressive causes.
