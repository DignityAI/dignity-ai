The Library's collection of Yiddish American sheet music is an unusual one for the Library of Congress. It began, not with a donation or purchase of materials which were then cataloged, but with a catalog. Lawrence Marwick, after retiring from his position as head of the Library's Hebraic Section in 1980, set out to compile a list of American Yiddish plays and music which had been submitted to the Library of Congress for copyright, recording information on some 5,000 index cards. Unbeknownst to Marwick, music historian and author Irene Heskes conducted a project to organize a collection of sheet music owned by the Hebrew Publishing Company of New York City. Her work came to the attention of Marwick and the Library of Congress, and the two scholars had planned to discuss their work but Marwick's untimely death the following year intervened. In 1984, Heskes began to revise and expand Marwick's unfinished work, adding composers, arrangers, publishers and other information, and culminating in the publication of American Popular Songs 1895 to 1950; A Catalog Based on the Lawrence Marwick Roster of Copyright Entries in 1992.
