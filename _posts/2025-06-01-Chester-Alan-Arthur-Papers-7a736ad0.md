The papers of Chester Alan Arthur (1829-1886), who became the twenty-first president of the United States in 1881 after James A. Garfield&rsquo;s assassination, consist of 4,400 items (7,675 images), most of which were digitized from 10 reels of previously produced microfilm. Spanning the years 1843-1960, with the bulk dating from 1870 to 1888, the collection contains correspondence, financial papers, scrapbooks, clippings, and other papers relating to Arthur&rsquo;s presidency, his service as collector of customs for the Port of New York, and his work with the New York Republican State Committee.
