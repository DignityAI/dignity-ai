The digitized portion of the Olmsted Associates Records consist of approximately 149,000 items (366,518 images), scanned from 532 reels of microfilm reproducing the two largest series in the collection, the Letterbooks, 1884-1899, and Job Files, 1863-1971, which document the work of the Brookline, Massachusetts, landscape architectural firm and its widespread projects and commissions undertaken for private and public clients in the United States and Canada. The Olmsted Associates Records overlap with, and continue beyond, materials in the closely related Frederick Law Olmsted Papers in the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress. They include materials from the last major projects in the career of Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), but mostly focus on the next generation and a new century, as Olmsted's two sons entered the landscape architecture profession under their father's tutelage, and then carried on the management and highly successful expansion of the Olmsted Brothers firm in the first half of the twentieth century.
