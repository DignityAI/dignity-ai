This collection consists primarily of the records (65,000 items; 190,918 images) of the Spanish colonial government of East Florida from 1784, when Spain regained the colony from Great Britain according to the terms of the Treaty of Paris External, which settled the Revolutionary War, until 1821, when Spain ceded Florida to the United States after the Adams-On√≠s Treaty External of 1819. Some records dating back to the early eighteenth century are included. The collection is largely in Spanish, with some in English. The digital scans were created from 175 reels of previously produced microfilm. A finding aid to the collection is available online (PDF and HTML) with links to the digital content on this site.
