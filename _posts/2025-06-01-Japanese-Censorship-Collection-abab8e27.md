The Japanese Censorship Collection contains 1,327 marked-up copies of censored monographs and galley proofs for approximately 1,100 titles, mostly from the 1920s and 1930s. They include copies submitted by publishers for examination by censors in the Home Ministry of the Japanese imperial government as well as books lawfully confiscated by the ministry and local authorities for censor review. The practice of censorship were carried out "to protect public order 'annei' and the manners and morals 'fuzoku'" in Japan. To achieve these ends, censors suppressed "kinshi", deleted "sakujo" or revised publications "kaitei" they deemed a threat to social and political stability.
