The files, 1908-1912, of the National Monetary Commission (2,362 items; 4,724 images) from the papers of U.S. representative and senator from Rhode Island Nelson W. Aldrich (1841-1915) are part of a larger collection available for research use onsite in the Manuscript Reading Room of the Library of Congress. Established by the Aldrich-Vreeland Act of 1908, the National Monetary Commission was created in order to study banking and currency operations at home and abroad and to suggest changes in American practices. Aldrich and other members of the commission visited England, France, and Germany to consult with experts and collect data. Specialists representing the commission made similar visits to other nations and reported their findings.
