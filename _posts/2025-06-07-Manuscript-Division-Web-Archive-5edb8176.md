The Manuscript Division Web Archive includes principally websites of organizations with which the Division has an existing relationship. Although diverse in content, they fall into several broad categories. First, there are sites for non-governmental, voluntary organizations, including civil rights and political advocacy groups whose records the division holds. Examples include the National Urban League, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (now the Civil Rights Coalition for the 21st Century), National Consumers' League, National Council of Jewish Women, National Endowment for Democracy, and the League of Women Voters.
