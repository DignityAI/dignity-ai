The Library of Congress Websites Web Archive is a collection of websites representing the Library's online presence. Some archived URLs map to specific parts of the organization, for example the American Folklife Center or the Law Library of Congress, and some focus on specific initiatives, such as National Native American Heritage Month or the Voices Remembering Slavery collection. The collection also includes domains associated with separate federal departments within the Library of Congress including copyright.gov and congress.gov. Official social media accounts, including content on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, is also included.
