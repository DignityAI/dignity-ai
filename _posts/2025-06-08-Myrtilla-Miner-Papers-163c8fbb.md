The papers of educator and abolitionist Myrtilla Miner (1815-1864) consist of approximately 600 items comprising 2,122 images, all of which were digitized from four reels of previously produced microfilm. Spanning the years 1825-1960, with most dating from 1850 to 1861, the collection includes correspondence, school essays, notes, clippings, printed matter, an unpublished biography by Lester Grosvenor Wells, and other papers relating to the Normal School for Colored Girls in Washington, D.C., slavery, the Civil War, feminism, and spiritualism. Correspondents include William Beecher, Walpole Cicil, Achsa Miner, Samuel Rhoads, Emma Dorothy Eliza Nevitte Southworth, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Benjamin Tatham, and members of the Miner family. The school Miner opened in 1851 came to be known as Miner Normal School and still later as Miner Teachers College, which became part of the District of Columbia&rsquo;s public school system.
