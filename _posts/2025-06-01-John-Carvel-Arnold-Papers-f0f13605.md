The papers of laborer and Union soldier John Carvel Arnold (1833-1865) consist of 190 items (533 images) in one container and span the years 1856-1937, with the bulk dating from 1864 to 1874. The collection principally contains correspondence of Arnold with his wife, Mary Ann Arnold, during his Civil War service with Company I, 49th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, U.S. Army, relating chiefly to his views on the military situation in Virginia and Maryland (1864-1865), army rations and pay, the Confederates, Copperhead Democrats, family finances, and his wife's difficulties in maintaining a home and educating the children. Mary Ann Arnold was unable to write, thus none of the correspondence in the collection is in her own handwriting.
