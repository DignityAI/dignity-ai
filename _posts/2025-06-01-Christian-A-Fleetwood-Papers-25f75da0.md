The papers of soldier and civic leader Christian Abraham Fleetwood (1840-1914) consist of approximately 400 items comprising 1,143 images, most of which were digitized from one reel of previously produced microfilm except for the photographs, which were scanned from the originals. Spanning the years 1797-1945, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1860-1907, the collection chiefly relates to Fleetwood&rsquo;s military career and his activities as a leading African American citizen of Washington, D.C. Included are papers relating to his wife Sara Iredell Fleetwood, a nurse; correspondence of other family members; and miscellaneous material.
