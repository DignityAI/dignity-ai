The Coronavirus Web Archive contains representative web-based content that documents the impact and response to the Covid-19 pandemic on communities across the United States and the world. This collection was curated by subject specialists from across the Library in order to present a multidisciplinary collection. Subjects and creators include: federal, state, local, and tribal government; science and technology; economics and labor; arts and culture; public and social policy; education; psychology; sports and recreation; and religion. African American, Asian American, Latino/a/x, and Native American communities are reflected in this collection as both web content creators and marginalized populations impacted by the pandemic. A sample of coronavirus content from Asia, South America, Africa, Europe, and Oceania is also featured in the collection.
