The Andrew Jackson Papers is one of twenty-three presidential collections in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress. The Jackson archival collection contains more than 26,000 items dating from 1767 to 1874. Included are memoranda, journals, speeches, military records, land deeds, and miscellaneous printed matter, as well as correspondence reflecting Jackson&rsquo;s personal life and career as a politician, military officer, president, slave holder and property owner. The bulk of the materials date from 1785, in the era when Jackson moved to North Carolina to study law, to Jackson's death at the Hermitage in Tennessee in 1845. The original collection was acquired by the Library of Congress through the generous gift of Woodbury Blair, Minna Blair Richey, Gist Blair, and Montgomery Blair in 1903, with additional acquisitions from 1901 to present.
