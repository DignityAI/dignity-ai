The Manuscript Division&rsquo;s Miscellaneous Manuscripts Collection, commonly called MMC-Alpha, is a group of approximately 5,825 small, individually cataloged collections, most dating from the mid-17th century to the mid-20th century and touching on a wide range of topics in American history. Digitization of these collections, estimated to reach about 120,000 images, began in late 2024. The first 148 collections, arranged alphabetically by name of creator or main entry and located in the first ten containers of the larger collection, were released online in March 2025, along with 6 other MMC-Alpha collections previously scanned as part of other projects. Each individual collection is no larger than a single folder, and many consist of just one or two items. Every month additional folders are scanned, and links to the digital files are added to the collections&rsquo; catalog records. The catalog records and images are then added to this collection presentation. To date, 6,733 images comprising 245 collections are gathered on this site.
