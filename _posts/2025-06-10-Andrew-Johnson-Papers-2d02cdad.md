The papers of vice president, senator, and representative Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), who became the seventeenth president of the Unites States in 1865 after Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination, consist of 40,000 items (63,710 images), most of which were digitized from 55 reels of previously produced microfilm. Spanning the years 1783-1947, with the bulk dating 1865-1869, the collection contains correspondence, memoranda, diaries, messages and speeches, courts-martial and amnesty records, financial records, lists, newspaper clippings, printed matter, scrapbooks, photographs, and other papers relating chiefly to Johnson&rsquo;s presidency. Subjects include the Civil War, National Union Party, Republican Party, Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s presidency and assassination, Reconstruction, and Johnson&rsquo;s presidential administration and impeachment. The collection also documents Johnson&rsquo;s service as military governor of Tennessee (1862-1865) and his business affairs, including his tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee. Shorthand diaries kept by Johnson&rsquo;s secretary, William G. Moore, are included in the collection and accompanied by typed transcriptions.
