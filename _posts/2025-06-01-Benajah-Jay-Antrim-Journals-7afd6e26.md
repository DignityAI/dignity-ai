The journals (5 items; 517 images) of Benajah Jay Antrim (1819-1903), a chemist, photographer, mathematical instrument maker, and artist, are comprised of three volumes of handwritten diary entries and two complementary volumes of pencil or pen-and-ink drawings and watercolor images of his February-April 1849 journey from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to San Francisco, California, through Mexico. The collection was purchased by the Library of Congress in 1906, and staff subsequently conserved and rebound the volumes. A portion of the journals was microfilmed in 1991, and the entire collection was digitized from the originals in 2024.
