The papers of lawyer and United States representative from Pennsylvania Thaddeus Stevens (1792-1868) consist of 4,750 items (7,769 images) in eight containers and one oversize folder. The material spans the years 1811-1927, with the bulk of the collection dating from 1850 to 1868. The collection consists principally of correspondence supplemented by speeches, legal, business, and financial records, biographical material, printed matter, and other papers relating chiefly to Stevens's service in the U.S. Congress and to family and business affairs.
