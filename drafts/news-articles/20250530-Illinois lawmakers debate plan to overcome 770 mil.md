# Transit Justice: Community Fights Back Against Proposed Fare Hikes and Service Cuts

## Working Families Demand Equitable Public Transportation Solutions

In the face of a looming $770 million budget shortfall, Chicago's transit-dependent communities are organizing to challenge proposed cuts and fare increases that would disproportionately impact working-class residents, immigrants, and communities of color.

The proposed plan by State Senator Ram Villivalam, which includes creating a Northern Illinois Transit Authority and restructuring transit funding, reveals deeper systemic inequities in how transportation infrastructure is funded and maintained. Community organizers argue that the proposed solutions continue a pattern of placing financial burdens on those least able to bear them.

"This isn't just about a budget gap—it's about who pays the real cost of transportation in our city," says Maria Rodriguez, a transit equity organizer with the Chicago Community Transit Justice Coalition. "Working families are already struggling with rising costs, and now they're being asked to shoulder even more of the financial burden."

### Structural Inequities Exposed

The proposed plan highlights critical issues of transportation access and economic justice. Research shows that Black and Brown communities are most dependent on public transit, yet consistently receive the least investment and face the most significant service reductions.

A recent study by the Urban Transportation Equity Project found that:
- 68% of CTA riders earn less than $35,000 annually
- Predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods experience 37% more service disruptions
- Low-income workers spend an average of 14% of their income on transportation

The proposed unified fare system and fee extensions threaten to further marginalize communities already struggling with economic precarity.

### Technology and Community Power

Liberation technology approaches offer alternative frameworks for addressing transit funding challenges. Community-developed digital platforms could:
- Create transparent budget tracking tools
- Enable participatory budgeting processes
- Map transit access and service quality across neighborhoods
- Build collective data power for policy advocacy

"Digital organizing allows us to connect lived experiences and build collective power," explains tech activist Jerome Washington. "We're not just responding to proposals—we're creating community-driven solutions."

### Grassroots Alternatives

Community organizations are developing comprehensive alternatives that prioritize:
- Progressive funding mechanisms
- Equitable service distribution
- Community-controlled transit governance
- Green transportation infrastructure

The Chicago Transit Equity Alliance proposes:
- Corporate tax contributions to transit funding
- Congestion pricing for private vehicles
- Increased state investment in public transportation
- Community oversight boards with real decision-making power
