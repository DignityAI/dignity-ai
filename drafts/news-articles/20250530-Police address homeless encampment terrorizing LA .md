# Housing Justice in Huntington Park: Community Resilience Against Systemic Displacement

## Unhoused Neighbors Face Criminalization While Deeper Structural Challenges Remain Unaddressed

In the heart of Huntington Park, a complex narrative of urban survival and systemic inequity is unfolding, revealing the deep-rooted challenges faced by our unhoused community members. Recent mainstream media coverage has framed unhoused residents as a "threat" to a medical professional's workspace, but our community-centered investigation exposes the intricate web of economic violence that produces housing precarity.

The current situation at Dr. Soliman's medical building represents a microcosm of broader systemic failures: inadequate affordable housing, broken social support systems, and a punitive approach to poverty that criminalizes survival strategies rather than addressing root causes.

Our research reveals that Huntington Park, like many working-class communities of color, has experienced accelerating gentrification and housing instability. Unhoused residents are not "terrorizing" spaces—they are human beings desperately seeking basic survival in a system designed to marginalize them.

### Structural Context: The Roots of Urban Displacement

The unhoused encampment represents more than an isolated incident. It reflects:
- Decades of discriminatory housing policies
- Massive wealth inequality
- Inadequate mental health and social support infrastructure
- A capitalist economic model that prioritizes property over human dignity

Liberation technology approaches demand we understand these systemic dynamics. Digital mapping and community data collection can help document patterns of displacement, track housing insecurity, and build strategic organizing networks.

### Community-Centered Solutions

Rather than police intervention or forced removal, our community demands:
- Rapid, dignified housing solutions
- Comprehensive mental health and addiction support
- Economic opportunities for marginalized residents
- Community-controlled housing development

Digital platforms can play a crucial role in these efforts. Blockchain-based community land trusts, collaborative mapping of vacant properties, and networked mutual aid platforms represent innovative technological approaches to housing justice.

### Voices from the Community

Maria, a local community organizer, shared: "These are our neighbors. They aren't a problem to be solved—they're community members experiencing profound systemic challenges. We need compassionate, holistic approaches."

José, who previously experienced homelessness, added: "Technology and organizing can help, but we need genuine human connection and systemic transformation."

**Community Organizing Opportunities:**

- Join the Huntington Park Housing Justice Coalition monthly meeting
- Participate in community mapping workshops
- Support digital mutual aid platforms like Mutual Aid Los Angeles
- Attend City Council meetings to demand affordable housing initiatives
- Connect with local organizations:
  * LA Community Action Network
  * People's City Council
  * Union de Vecinos

### Liberation Technology Strategy

Our approach integrates:
- Community-driven data collection
- Digital storytelling platforms
- Networked mutual aid technologies
- Transparent, participatory decision-making tools

The goal isn't just documenting challenges but building collective power and transformative solutions.

### Call to Action

This isn't about "managing" homelessness—it's about reimagining community, challenging systemic oppression, and creating genuine human solidarity.

We invite all community members to move beyond spectator narratives and become active participants in building just, compassionate urban ecosystems.

Solidarity is our technology. Collective liberation is our goal.
