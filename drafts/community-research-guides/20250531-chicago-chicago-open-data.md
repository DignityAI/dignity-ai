# COMMUNITY DATA ORGANIZING GUIDE
## How to Use Chicago Open Data for Liberation

### Why Community-Controlled Data Matters

In a world where data often reinforces existing power structures, community-controlled research is a radical act of self-determination. Government and institutional data can become a powerful tool for liberation when communities learn to analyze, interpret, and strategically use information to challenge systemic oppression.

### Community Research Methodology

#### Asking the Right Questions
Community-centered research asks:
