# COMMUNITY DATA ORGANIZING GUIDE
## How to Use Chicago Open Data for Liberation

### Why Community-Controlled Data Matters

Data is power. For too long, communities of color and working-class neighborhoods have been studied, analyzed, and controlled by outside institutions that do not understand or respect community experiences. Community-controlled research flips this script, transforming data from a tool of oppression into a weapon of liberation.

In Chicago, open data provides a critical opportunity for communities to understand systemic inequalities, expose power structures, and develop strategic organizing approaches. By learning to read, analyze, and weaponize government data, communities can:
- Expose racial and economic disparities
- Challenge official narratives
- Build evidence-based advocacy campaigns
- Create targeted organizing strategies

### Getting Started with Chicago Open Data

#### Essential Datasets for Organizing
Key datasets for community power analysis include:
- Chicago Police Department arrest and use of force data
- City budget allocations
- Economic development investments
- Housing and eviction records
- School funding and performance data
- 311 service request databases

#### Reading the Data Like an Organizer

Community data analysis isn't about academic neutralityâ€”it's about understanding power. When examining datasets, ask:
- Who is being targeted?
- Where are resources being concentrated or withheld?
- What systematic patterns emerge?
- How do these numbers connect to community experiences?

#### Tools Communities Can Use
Free tools for community data analysis:
- Chicago Data Portal (data.cityofchicago.org)
- Google Sheets
- Tableau Public
- R (statistical programming language)
- Python data analysis libraries

### Community Research Methodology

#### Asking the Right Questions
Community research starts with community knowledge. Before diving into datasets, gather:
- Neighborhood oral histories
- Community listening sessions
- Personal testimonies
- Collective experiences of oppression

These lived experiences will guide your data analysis and ensure the research serves community needs.

#### Identifying Power and Targeting Patterns

Look beyond individual data points to see systematic oppression:
- Compare resources across neighborhoods
- Track racial disparities in arrests, investments, services
- Identify consistent patterns of institutional violence
- Connect numerical data to community stories

#### Connecting Data to Community Experience

Data is most powerful when validated by community knowledge. Always:
- Cross-reference datasets with community narratives
- Host community interpretation sessions
- Allow impacted people to analyze and contextualize findings
- Center community voice in research presentation

### Using Data for Organizing

#### Data-Driven Community Education
Transform complex datasets into:
- Infographics
- Community presentations
- Know-Your-Rights workshops
- Popular education materials

#### Evidence-Based Advocacy
Use data to:
- Pressure aldermen
- Develop policy proposals
- Challenge institutional practices
- Build legal cases

### Data Security and Protection

#### Protecting Community Information
- Anonymize individual data
- Use aggregate statistics
- Obtain informed consent
- Protect vulnerable community members

### Building Community Research Capacity

The ultimate goal is not just analysis, but building sustained community research infrastructure. This means:
- Training multiple community researchers
- Developing collaborative research processes
- Creating systems for ongoing data collection
- Connecting research to direct action

### From Data to Power: Making Research Organizing

Community-controlled research is a revolutionary act. By transforming government data into a tool for liberation, communities can:
- Expose systemic oppression
- Build collective consciousness
- Create strategic organizing campaigns
- Reclaim narrative power

Remember: Data is a weapon. Aim carefully.
