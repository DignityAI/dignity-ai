I'll provide the two case studies focusing on the dignity lens analysis of maternal athletic performance and systemic barriers.

# CASE STUDY A: LOCAL SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS - Snowdonia, Wales: Maternal Athletic Performance and Regional Gender Dynamics

## Executive Summary
This case study examines the intersectional challenges of maternal athletic performance through the lens of Stephanie Case's ultramarathon victory in Snowdonia, Wales, revealing complex local gender dynamics and institutional barriers facing athlete-mothers.

## Institutional Memory Context
Snowdonia represents a unique geographical and cultural landscape with historically rigid gender expectations. The region's mountainous terrain has traditionally been associated with masculine athletic pursuits, with women's athletic achievements historically marginalized. Case's performance disrupts multiple systemic narratives:

1. Regional athletic expectations
2. Maternal role constraints
3. Age-related athletic performance limitations

## Local Dignity Lens Analysis

### Power Structures (Regional Level)
- Traditional Welsh athletic institutions prioritize male-centric performance metrics
- Limited infrastructure supporting maternal athletes
- Implicit age and gender-based performance expectations

### Control Mechanisms 
- Institutional sports regulations limiting flexible participation
- Societal expectations of maternal "limitations"
- Lack of nutritional/logistical support for breastfeeding athletes

### Community Resistance
- Grassroots athletic networks challenging normative narratives
- Social media amplification of non-traditional athletic achievements
- Emerging support networks for athlete-mothers

### Liberation Strategies
- Policy advocacy for inclusive athletic participation
- Flexible competition frameworks
- Nutritional and logistical support for maternal athletes

## Local Organizing Opportunities
1. Develop regional athletic support networks for mothers
2. Create policy recommendations for inclusive athletic frameworks
3. Develop mentorship programs challenging maternal performance stereotypes

## Conclusion
Case's performance represents a critical intervention in regional athletic and maternal narratives, demonstrating the potential for systemic transformation through individual agency.
