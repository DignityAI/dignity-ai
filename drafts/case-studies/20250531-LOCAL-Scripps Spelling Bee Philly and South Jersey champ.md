I'll generate two case studies using the Dignity Lens framework, focusing on educational opportunity and academic achievement through the lens of the Scripps Spelling Bee participants.

# CASE STUDY A: Philadelphia & South Jersey - Educational Opportunity Pathways

## Executive Summary
This case study examines the educational ecosystem surrounding academic competition, specifically the Scripps Spelling Bee, through the experiences of Jayden Jiang (Philadelphia) and Isaac Geremew (South Jersey), revealing complex dynamics of educational access, cultural capital, and systemic opportunity structures.

## Local Dignity Lens Analysis

### Power Structures (City/County/State Level)
- Philadelphia and South Jersey represent distinct educational landscapes with uneven resource distribution
- Regional spelling bee competitions operate as gatekeeping mechanisms for academic excellence
- WHYY and local media play crucial role in amplifying student achievements
- Socioeconomic barriers persist in competitive academic environments

### Control Mechanisms (How This Operates Locally)
- Spelling bee requires extensive preparation, privileging students with:
  1. Additional academic resources
  2. Parental educational support
  3. Supplemental learning opportunities
- Language proficiency and cultural capital significantly impact competition success
- Regional qualifying processes create hierarchical academic screening

### Community Resistance (Local Organizing Examples)
- Multilingual student participation challenges traditional academic normativity
- Family and community support networks crucial for student preparation
- Geremew and Jiang represent first-generation academic achievers challenging systemic barriers

### Liberation Strategies (What's Worked in This City)
- Community-sponsored academic enrichment programs
- Media representation of diverse student achievements
- Collaborative learning models that democratize competitive academic spaces

## Local Organizing Opportunities
- Develop comprehensive spelling bee preparation programs in underserved communities
- Create mentorship networks connecting past and current academic competitors
- Advocate for equitable educational resource allocation

## Conclusion
The spelling bee represents both a microcosm of educational opportunity and a platform for challenging systemic academic inequities.
