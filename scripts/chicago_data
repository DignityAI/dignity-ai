       Using the Dignity Lens framework, identify core themes and systematic patterns:

       ## SYSTEMATIC THEMES IDENTIFIED
       
       ### Primary Systematic Functions
       - What systematic functions does this issue serve for maintaining racial oppression?
       - How does this connect to wealth extraction, social control, or community suppression?
       - What essential patterns repeat across different contexts and time periods?

       ### Historical Pattern Recognition  
       - Which of the 7 historical eras show similar patterns to this current issue?
       - How have the methods evolved while maintaining the same systematic functions?
       - What resistance strategies from past eras inform current organizing?

       ## DIGNITY LENS DOMAIN MAPPING

       ### Power Structures (Decision-Making Control)
       - Who holds formal authority over decisions related to this issue?
       - What institutions, corporations, or networks control resources and policy?
       - How are communities systematically excluded from decision-making?

       ### Control Mechanisms (Community Suppression)
       - What specific tactics contain or suppress community power around this issue?
       - How do these mechanisms appear neutral while producing racial disparities?
       - What legal, economic, or cultural justifications are used?

       ### Community Resistance (Fighting Back)
       - How have communities historically resisted this form of oppression?
       - What current organizing exists around this issue?
       - What innovations or adaptations are communities developing?

       ### Liberation Strategies (Building Power)
       - What approaches have successfully built lasting community power around this issue?
       - How do successful strategies address root causes rather than just symptoms?
       - What infrastructure or institutions do communities need to control?

       ## CROSS-SYSTEM CONNECTIONS
       - How does this issue intersect with other forms of systematic oppression?
       - What institutions work together to maintain these patterns?
       - Where are the leverage points for community organizing?

       Focus on systematic patterns that reveal how oppression operates and can be challenged.

       ## SYSTEMATIC CONTRADICTIONS

       ### Official Narrative vs. Community Reality
       - How do government/corporate narratives about this issue contradict community experiences?
       - What "colorblind" or "neutral" language hides systematic targeting?
       - How do diversity/inclusion efforts mask continued systematic oppression?

       ### Reform vs. Liberation Tensions
       - How do reform approaches potentially strengthen the systems they claim to fix?
       - What tensions exist between "fixing" systems vs. building community alternatives?
       - Where do individual advancement strategies conflict with community liberation?

       ### Historical Pattern Contradictions
       - How have past "solutions" actually adapted systematic oppression rather than eliminating it?
       - What resistance strategies have been co-opted or neutralized?
       - How do communities balance survival needs with liberation goals?

       ## ANALYTICAL GAPS AND SILENCED PERSPECTIVES

       ### Missing Community Voices
       - Whose perspectives are systematically excluded from mainstream analysis?
       - How might different community members (age, gender, documentation status) experience this differently?
       - What organizing knowledge is ignored by academic or policy experts?

       ### Unasked Questions
       - What questions would communities ask that institutions avoid?
       - How does focusing on individual cases hide systematic patterns?
       - What historical context is deliberately omitted from public discussion?

       ### Hidden Power Relationships
       - What economic interests benefit from maintaining current arrangements?
       - How do different oppression systems reinforce each other around this issue?
       - What role do "allies" or "progressive" institutions play in maintaining oppression?

       ## ORGANIZING STRATEGY TENSIONS

       ### Immediate vs. Long-term
       - How do urgent community needs conflict with long-term liberation strategy?
       - What compromises do communities face when engaging with oppressive institutions?
       - How do communities balance harm reduction with systematic transformation?

       ### Coalition vs. Community Control
       - When do coalition-building efforts dilute community self-determination?
       - How do communities maintain leadership while building broader alliances?
       - What tensions exist between different community organizing approaches?

Community organizing groups like the Stop Police Surveillance Coalition have documented how this technology criminalizes daily life activities, with predictive policing algorithms directing police attention to areas where communities of color live, work, and organize.

The organizing revealed how school closures served multiple systematic functions: weakening community institutions that anchor neighborhoods, creating real estate opportunities for developers, and disrupting intergenerational networks that support community organizing.
