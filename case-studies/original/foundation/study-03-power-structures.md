# **STUDY #3: POWER STRUCTURES DOMAIN**
## *Who Controls Decisions and How Power is **[PERSON_NAME]** Maintained*

---

### **The Room Where It Happens**

In **[DATE]** 2013, **[LOCATION]** Chicago Mayor **[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** Rahm Emanuel announced the largest mass **[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** school closure in U.S. history - 50 schools, predominantly serving Black and brown communities on the South and West sides. The decision affected 12,000 students and eliminated 3,000 jobs, but it wasn't made in community meetings or school board hearings where parents could **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** influence the outcome.

The real decision happened in closed-door meetings between Emanuel, his appointed Chicago Public Schools CEO **[PERSON_NAME]** Barbara Byrd-Bennett, and corporate consultants from firms like **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group. The communities whose children attended these schools - who would bear the consequences of longer **[MECHANISM:GEOGRAPHIC_CONTAINMENT]** commutes, disrupted education, and eliminated jobs - had no seat at the table where their **[ERA:ABOLITIONIST_FUTURING]** futures were decided.

This is how Power Structures operate: the people most affected by decisions have the least influence over making them, while those who benefit from the **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** outcomes control the decision-making process entirely.

Understanding Power Structures through the Dignity Lens reveals not just who holds formal **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** authority, but how that authority is maintained, who benefits from current arrangements, and how communities are systematically excluded from decisions that shape their lives. More importantly, it shows how communities can build alternative power structures that serve **[DOMAIN:LIBERATION_STRATEGIES]** liberation rather than oppression.

---

### ****[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** Defining **[PERSON_NAME]** Power Structures: The First Domain of the Dignity Lens**

Power Structures examine who holds decision-making authority and how that authority is maintained across institutions, sectors, and systems. This domain goes beyond formal positions to analyze the networks, relationships, and mechanisms that determine who gets to shape policy, allocate resources, and control information.

Power Structures include:

- Government institutions: Who holds **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** elected and **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** appointed positions, who influences their decisions, and how **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** community input is structured (or prevented)
- Corporate control: Who owns major employers, developers, and service providers, and how their interests shape community **[MECHANISM:ECONOMIC_EXCLUSION]** development
- Educational governance: Who controls curriculum, **[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** funding, and personnel decisions in schools and universities
- Healthcare administration: Who determines treatment protocols, resource allocation, and community **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** health priorities
- Media ownership: Who controls information flow, narrative framing, and which voices get amplified or suppressed
- Financial institutions: Who controls lending, investment, and resource allocation decisions
- Legal authority: Who determines **[MECHANISM:POLICE_TARGETING]** law enforcement priorities, judicial appointments, and **[STRATEGY:LEGAL_CHALLENGES]** legal system operations

But Power Structures aren't just about individual positions - they're about how these positions connect to maintain systematic exclusion while appearing **[DOMAIN:LIBERATION_STRATEGIES]** democratic and merit-based.

### **How **[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** Power Structures Maintain Systematic Exclusion**

The **[LOCATION]** Chicago **[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** school closures reveal how Power Structures operate systematically to maintain racial inequality while providing plausible deniability about discriminatory intent.

#### **The Network of Decision-Makers:**

MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL: Former Wall Street investment banker and **[PERSON_NAME]** Obama administration official, appointed (not elected) to lead Chicago Public Schools **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** turnaround. No background in education, but extensive connections to corporate and **[MECHANISM:ECONOMIC_EXCLUSION]** financial interests that benefit from school privatization.

CEO BARBARA BYRD-BENNETT: Appointed by Emanuel from outside Chicago, previously implemented similar corporate education reforms in Detroit and Cleveland. Later convicted of federal corruption charges for steering no-bid contracts to education consulting firm SUPES Academy in exchange for kickbacks.

CORPORATE CONSULTANTS: McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group, hired to conduct "efficiency analysis" that predetermined school closure recommendations. These firms have financial interests in education privatization and charter school expansion.

CHICAGO BOARD OF EDUCATION: Entirely appointed by the **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** mayor (not elected by communities), with members drawn from corporate and financial backgrounds rather than education or community organizing experience.

#### **The Exclusion of Community Voice:**

PARENTS AND STUDENTS: Despite being most affected by closures, had no formal role in decision-making process. Community meetings were held after decisions were made, framed as "input sessions" rather than decision-making forums.

TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF: Union representatives and educators with direct school experience were excluded from closure planning. Their expertise was dismissed as "special interest" **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** influence.

COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS: Groups representing affected **[MECHANISM:GEOGRAPHIC_CONTAINMENT]** neighborhoods were not consulted during decision-making process, only invited to comment on predetermined **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** outcomes.

ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD: Chicago is one of the few major cities without an elected school board, removing community control over education decisions entirely.

This structure ensured that those who benefited from school closures controlled the decision-making process, while those who bore the costs were systematically excluded from meaningful participation.

### **Historical Evolution of **[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** Power Structures**

Understanding current Power Structures requires analyzing how they evolved across the seven historical eras examined through the Dignity Lens. Each era adapted methods for maintaining white control while responding to Black community organizing.

#### **Era 1-2: Enslavement & Reconstruction (1600s-1910)**
**Explicit Exclusion:** Black people **[STRATEGY:LEGAL_CHALLENGES]** legally excluded from political participation, property ownership, and decision-making in all institutions. Power concentrated in white male property owners with direct **[MECHANISM:ECONOMIC_EXCLUSION]** economic interests in Black oppression.

#### **Era 3: **[PERSON_NAME]** Jim Crow (**[DATE]** 1910-1950)**  
**Separate and Unequal:** Legal **[ERA:JIM_CROW]** segregation created parallel institutions controlled by different power structures. Black institutions (**[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** schools, churches, businesses) developed **[DOMAIN:LIBERATION_STRATEGIES]** community-controlled leadership, while white institutions maintained exclusive control over resources and policy.

#### **Era 4: Civil Rights Era (1950-1975)**
**Integration Without Power:** Legal victories opened **[MECHANISM:GEOGRAPHIC_CONTAINMENT]** **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** access to previously white institutions, but control remained concentrated in white leadership. Black people gained individual positions without changing institutional power structures or decision-making processes.

#### **Era 5: Neoliberalization (1975-2008)**
**Corporate Capture:** Public institutions increasingly controlled by corporate interests rather than community input. "Efficiency" and "**[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** accountability" became justifications for removing community control and concentrating decision-making in appointed (rather than **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** elected) positions.

#### **Era 6-7: Digital Era to Present (2008-Present)**
**Algorithmic Authority:** Technology platforms controlled by predominantly white corporate leadership gain unprecedented **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** influence over information, economic opportunity, and social interaction. AI systems embed existing power relationships while claiming objectivity.

The pattern across eras: methods for maintaining white control adapt to community resistance, but essential function remains constant - excluding Black communities from decisions that affect their lives while concentrating benefits among white-controlled institutions and networks.

### ****[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** Contemporary Power Structures: **[LOCATION]** Chicago Case Study**

Chicago provides a comprehensive example of how Power Structures operate in contemporary urban contexts, showing connections between government, corporate, and institutional authority that maintain racial inequality across multiple sectors.

#### **Government Power Structures:**

MAYORAL CONTROL: Chicago's **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** mayor has unprecedented power compared to other major cities, with authority to appoint **[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** school board, housing authority leadership, and **[MECHANISM:POLICE_TARGETING]** police superintendent without meaningful **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** community input or elected oversight.

CITY COUNCIL: 50 aldermen represent individual wards, but key decisions (budget, **[MECHANISM:ECONOMIC_EXCLUSION]** development, police) remain concentrated in mayor's office and finance committee controlled by downtown business interests.

COUNTY AND STATE: Cook County and Illinois state government controlled by officials who depend on campaign contributions from real estate, financial, and corporate interests that benefit from policies affecting Chicago's Black communities.

#### **Corporate Power Structures:**  

REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT: Major developers like Sterling Bay, **[PERSON_NAME]** Related Midwest, and McCaffery Interests control waterfront and downtown development while displacing longtime residents from gentrifying **[MECHANISM:GEOGRAPHIC_CONTAINMENT]** neighborhoods.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and other major lenders make mortgage and business loan decisions that determine **[STRATEGY:COMMUNITY_LAND_TRUSTS]** community development patterns and individual economic opportunities.

HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS: Hospital consolidation means a few major systems (Northwestern, University of Chicago, Rush) control **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** healthcare access and resource allocation across the city, often prioritizing profitable suburban expansion over **[STRATEGY:COMMUNITY_HEALTH_WORKERS]** community health needs.

#### **Institutional Power Structures:**

CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS: Appointed board and CEO structure removes community control while charter school expansion diverts resources from traditional public schools serving Black and brown communities.

CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT: Superintendent appointed by mayor, with union contract and "qualified immunity" **[STRATEGY:LEGAL_CHALLENGES]** legal protection that prevents community **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** accountability for police violence and misconduct.

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO: Major landowner and employer on South Side, with significant influence over development and city policy, but governance structure that excludes community input from affected neighborhoods.

#### **The Network Effect:**

These Power Structures don't operate independently - they form interconnected networks where the same people and interests influence decisions across multiple institutions:

- Corporate board members serve simultaneously on hospital, university, and foundation boards
- Law firms represent developers, city government, and police department in conflicts with community organizations  
- Consulting firms hired by multiple institutions to implement similar policies across sectors
- Campaign contributors influence **[MECHANISM:VOTER_SUPPRESSION]** **[STRATEGY:ELECTORAL_ORGANIZING]** elections and policy across federal, state, and local levels

This network structure means that challenging any single institution requires understanding how power operates across the entire system.

---

### **How Power Structures Prevent Community Control**

Power Structures maintain **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** systematic exclusion through specific mechanisms that appear **[DOMAIN:LIBERATION_STRATEGIES]** democratic while preventing meaningful community influence:

#### **Appointment vs. Election:**
- Chicago School Board: Appointed by **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** mayor, not elected by communities
- Police Superintendent: Appointed by mayor, not accountable to community oversight
- Housing Authority: Appointed leadership, not tenant or community representation
- Hospital Boards: Appointed by existing members, not community **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** health needs

#### **Technical Expertise **[PERSON_NAME]** Requirements:**
- Budget Processes: Require specialized knowledge that excludes community participation
- Development Approvals: Use zoning and planning language that prevents meaningful **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** community input
- Healthcare Decisions: Rely on medical expertise that dismisses community-defined health needs
- Educational Policy: Require specialized credentials that exclude parent and student voices

#### **Resource Barriers:**
- Campaign Finance: Elections determined by corporate contributions rather than **[STRATEGY:MUTUAL_AID]** community support
- Legal Representation: Policy challenges require expensive **[STRATEGY:LEGAL_CHALLENGES]** legal expertise most communities cannot afford
- Information Access: Key decisions made in closed meetings with limited public documentation
- Time Requirements: Community participation structured during work hours when most people cannot attend

#### **Geographic Representation:**
- At-Large Elections: Dilute community **[MECHANISM:VOTER_SUPPRESSION]** **[STRATEGY:ELECTORAL_ORGANIZING]** voting power by requiring citywide rather than **[MECHANISM:GEOGRAPHIC_CONTAINMENT]** neighborhood-based campaigns
- Gerrymandering: Draw district boundaries to divide Black communities across multiple districts
- Residency Requirements: Allow decision-makers to live outside communities affected by their decisions

These mechanisms ensure that Power Structures remain controlled by those who benefit from systematic inequality while providing appearance of democratic participation and community input.

### ****[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** Community Resistance to **[PERSON_NAME]** Power Structures**

Despite systematic exclusion from formal Power Structures, Black communities in **[LOCATION]** Chicago have developed multiple strategies for building alternative power and challenging existing arrangements:

#### **Electoral Organizing:**
CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION: Built grassroots power that elected union leadership committed to community schools rather than corporate education reform, then used that base to influence **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** mayoral and city council elections.

JOURNEY4JUSTICE: Coalition organizing that successfully prevented additional school closures and forced policy changes around school **[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** discipline and special education through combination of electoral and **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** direct action strategies.

PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING: Community organizing that forced city council to allocate portions of ward budgets through direct community **[MECHANISM:VOTER_SUPPRESSION]** **[STRATEGY:ELECTORAL_ORGANIZING]** voting rather than aldermanic discretion.

#### **Direct Action and Civil Disobedience:**
DYETT HIGH SCHOOL HUNGER STRIKE: Community organizing including **[DATE]** 34-day hunger strike that forced CPS to reverse closure decision and implement community vision for school programming.

HOMAN SQUARE PROTESTS: Organizing that exposed **[MECHANISM:POLICE_TARGETING]** police torture site and forced policy changes around police **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** accountability and community oversight.

HOSPITAL CLOSURE PROTESTS: Community organizing that prevented multiple **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** hospital closures on South and West sides through direct action, **[STRATEGY:LEGAL_CHALLENGES]** legal challenges, and regulatory pressure.

#### **Alternative Institution Building:**
KENWOOD OAKLAND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION (KOCO): Develops community-controlled **[STRATEGY:COMMUNITY_LAND_TRUSTS]** affordable housing and provides alternative to gentrification-driven **[MECHANISM:ECONOMIC_EXCLUSION]** development.

SOUTHSIDE TOGETHER ORGANIZING FOR POWER (STOP): Builds community power through leadership development, direct action, and alternative economic development projects.

CHICAGO FREEDOM SCHOOL: Provides alternative educational programming that centers Black history and community organizing as part of curriculum.

#### **Legal and Policy Challenges:**
TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE LAW PROJECT: Challenges discriminatory policing and criminal **[DOMAIN:LIBERATION_STRATEGIES]** justice policies while building community alternatives to carceral system.

CHICAGO LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS: Legal challenges to discriminatory housing, education, and employment policies that maintain racial inequality.

ONE NORTHSIDE: Multi-issue organizing that combines legal advocacy, direct action, and electoral organizing to challenge gentrification and build community-controlled development.

---

### ****[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** Building Alternative **[PERSON_NAME]** Power Structures**

The most successful community organizing doesn't just challenge existing Power Structures - it builds alternative structures that demonstrate community control and provide models for systematic change.

#### **Community-Controlled Economic Development:**

EVERGREEN COOPERATIVES (**[LOCATION]** Cleveland model applicable to Chicago): Network of worker-owned businesses that keep economic resources in community while providing sustainable employment and **[DOMAIN:LIBERATION_STRATEGIES]** **[STRATEGY:WORKER_COOPERATIVES]** democratic workplace control.

COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS: Remove land from speculative market while maintaining community control over **[MECHANISM:ECONOMIC_EXCLUSION]** development, preventing displacement while enabling community-controlled improvement.

CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS: Provide financial services controlled by community members rather than external **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** corporate interests, with lending priorities determined by **[STRATEGY:COMMUNITY_LAND_TRUSTS]** community development needs.

#### **Community-Controlled Education:**

PARENT ORGANIZING: Builds power to influence **[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** school policy through **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** elected school board **[STRATEGY:ELECTORAL_ORGANIZING]** campaigns, community participation in budget and personnel decisions, and alternative educational programming.

COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL: Integrates **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** health services, adult education, and community organizing into school programming, making schools centers of community power rather than sites of containment.

POPULAR EDUCATION PROGRAMS: Political education, know-your-rights training, and leadership development that builds community capacity to participate in decision-making across multiple institutions.

#### **Community-Controlled Healthcare:**

COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAMS: Train community members to provide health education, advocacy, and connection to services while building organizing capacity around health justice issues.

COMMUNITY-CONTROLLED CLINICS: Governance structures that include community **[MECHANISM:VOTER_SUPPRESSION]** representation in healthcare decision-making, with priorities determined by community-defined health needs rather than profit maximization.

HEALTH JUSTICE ORGANIZING: Combines direct service provision with policy advocacy and community organizing to address social determinants of health through community power building.

#### **Community-Controlled Media:**

COMMUNITY JOURNALISM: Resident-led media that covers local issues from community perspective, provides platform for **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** community voices, and builds capacity for ongoing civic engagement.

DIGITAL ORGANIZING PLATFORMS: Community-controlled **[ERA:DIGITAL_REBELLION]** social media and communication infrastructure that reduces dependence on corporate platforms while building organizing capacity.

CULTURAL ORGANIZING: Music, art, and cultural programming that builds community identity while challenging dominant narratives and creating alternative vision for community development.

---

### **Strategic Analysis: Where Power Actually Lies**

Understanding **[PERSON_NAME]** Power Structures through the Dignity Lens requires analyzing not just formal authority, but where real decision-making power is concentrated and how community organizing can most effectively challenge those arrangements.

#### **Financial Control Points:**
- Federal Policy: Housing, **[MECHANISM:HEALTHCARE_RATIONING]** healthcare, education, and criminal **[DOMAIN:LIBERATION_STRATEGIES]** justice **[MECHANISM:EDUCATIONAL_LIMITATION]** funding determined by federal priorities that local organizing cannot directly **[DOMAIN:COMMUNITY_RESISTANCE]** influence
- State Policy: Property tax structures, school funding formulas, and criminal justice policies that shape local conditions
- Corporate Investment: Private capital flows that determine employment, **[MECHANISM:ECONOMIC_EXCLUSION]** development, and service availability
- Foundation Funding: Nonprofit sector increasingly dependent on foundation priorities that may not align with community self-determination

#### **Information Control Points:**
- Media Ownership: Local news increasingly controlled by national corporate chains with standardized programming that excludes community perspectives
- Social Media Algorithms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and **[ORGANIZATION_NAME]** TikTok **[ERA:DIGITAL_REBELLION]** algorithms controlled by corporate interests that can suppress organizing content
- Educational Curriculum: Textbook adoption and standardized testing controlled by state and corporate interests that limit community control over what children learn
- Research and Data: University and consulting firm research that shapes policy often funded by interests that benefit from current arrangements

#### **Legal and Regulatory Control Points:**
- Court System: Judges appointed or elected through processes influenced by corporate campaign contributions
- Regulatory Agencies: Appointed **[DOMAIN:POWER_STRUCTURES]** officials who determine enforcement priorities for housing, environmental, and labor protections
- Police and Prosecution: Law enforcement priorities determined by appointed officials rather than community **[DOMAIN:CONTROL_MECHANISMS]** accountability
- Licensing and Permitting: Business and development approval processes controlled by appointed boards

#### **Strategic Intervention Points:**
Based on this analysis, community organizing can most effectively challenge Power Structures by focusing on:

ELECTORAL ORGANIZING that builds community **[MECHANISM:VOTER_SUPPRESSION]** **[STRATEGY:ELECTORAL_ORGANIZING]** voting power sufficient to influence appointments and policy priorities

ECONOMIC ORGANIZING that reduces community dependence on external corporate control while building independent economic power

LEGAL AND POLICY ORGANIZING that changes structural rules rather than just individual decisions

COALITION BUILDING that connects communities across racial and geographic lines to build power sufficient to challenge systematic arrangements

ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTION BUILDING that demonstrates community capacity for self-governance while reducing dependence on existing power structures
**  
**Separate and Unequal:** Legal segregation created parallel institutions controlled by different power structures. Black institutions (schools, churches, businesses) developed community-controlled leadership, while white institutions maintained exclusive control over resources and policy.

#### **Era 4: Civil Rights Era (1950-1975)**
**Integration Without Power:** Legal victories opened access to previously white institutions, but control remained concentrated in white leadership. Black people gained individual positions without changing institutional power structures or decision-making processes.

#### **Era 6-7: Digital Era to Present (2008-Present)**
**Algorithmic Authority:** Technology platforms controlled by predominantly white corporate leadership gain unprecedented influence over information, economic opportunity, and social interaction. AI systems embed existing power relationships while claiming objectivity.

The pattern across eras: **methods for maintaining white control adapt to community resistance**, but essential function remains constant - excluding Black communities from decisions that affect their lives while concentrating benefits among white-controlled institutions and networks.

### **Connections Across the Dignity Lens Framework**

Understanding Power Structures provides the foundation for analyzing how systematic racism operates across all domains of the Dignity Lens. This analysis connects directly to:

- **How Power Structures maintain themselves through specific control mechanisms** - the policies, practices, and systems that contain Black communities and prevent effective resistance (*Study #4: Control Mechanisms Domain*)

- **How communities organize resistance strategies** that challenge existing Power Structures while building alternative arrangements (*Study #5: Community Resistance & Liberation Strategies*)

- **How Power Structures have evolved across seven historical eras** to maintain essential functions while adapting to community resistance (*Study #2: How Racism Evolved*)  

- **How the four domains of the Dignity Lens work together** to create systematic racial oppression while communities develop comprehensive liberation strategies (*Study #1: What is Systematic Racism?*)

The Power Structures analysis also applies to understanding how systematic racism operates in specific institutional sectors:

- **Medical institutions** where predominantly white leadership controls healthcare access, research priorities, and resource allocation while excluding community-defined health needs (*Medical Racism & Community Health*)

- **Legal institutions** where appointed judges, prosecutors, and police leadership maintain criminal justice policies that target Black communities (*Legal System & Mass Incarceration*)

- **Educational institutions** where appointed boards and corporate consultants control curriculum, funding, and personnel decisions affecting Black students (*Education & School-to-Prison Pipeline*)

- **Economic institutions** where corporate and financial leadership controls employment, lending, and development decisions that maintain wealth gaps (*Economic Exclusion & Community Wealth Building*)

---

### **From Analysis to Action: Building Community Power in Chicago**

Understanding Power Structures through the Dignity Lens creates strategic opportunities for building community power in Chicago:

**CHALLENGE EXISTING POWER STRUCTURES** through strategic organizing:
- **ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD CAMPAIGN:** Organize for community control of education decisions currently made by mayoral appointees
- **POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY ORGANIZING:** Build community oversight with real authority over police department policies and personnel
- **PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING EXPANSION:** Force city council to allocate larger portions of municipal budget through direct community voting
- **COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENTS:** Require developers to negotiate directly with community organizations about development impacts and community priorities

**BUILD ALTERNATIVE POWER STRUCTURES** that demonstrate community control:
- **COMMUNITY land trust development** that removes land from speculative market while maintaining community control over development priorities
- **WORKER COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT:** Support employee-owned businesses that keep economic resources in community while providing democratic workplace control
- **COMMUNITY-CONTROLLED HEALTHCARE:** Develop health centers with community representation in governance and service priorities
- **INDEPENDENT MEDIA DEVELOPMENT:** Build community-controlled information infrastructure that reduces dependence on corporate media

**DEVELOP ORGANIZING CAPACITY** to participate effectively in decision-making:
- **LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS:** Political education and skill-building that prepares community members for participation in institutional decision-making
- **POLICY ANALYSIS TRAINING:** Build community capacity to understand budget processes, zoning decisions, and regulatory frameworks
- **COALITION BUILDING:** Connect across racial, geographic, and issue lines to build power sufficient to influence systematic decisions
- **ELECTORAL ORGANIZING:** Build community voting power sufficient to influence elections and appointments at multiple levels of government

**CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS** that ensure community influence over decisions:
- **COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT BOARDS:** With real authority over police, schools, housing, and healthcare institutions
- **PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH:** Community-controlled data collection and analysis that challenges expert narratives with community knowledge
- **TRANSPARENCY CAMPAIGNS:** Force disclosure of decision-making processes, financial relationships, and policy rationales
- **DIRECT ACTION:** Strategic disruption that raises costs of decisions made without community input

---

### **Conclusion: Who Decides Determines Everything**

The 2013 Chicago school closures weren't an educational policy decision - they were a **Power Structure decision** that prioritized corporate interests over community needs. Understanding this distinction is essential for developing effective organizing strategies.

Power Structures determine not just individual policy outcomes, but **the fundamental framework for how decisions get made** - who gets consulted, whose expertise is valued, whose interests are prioritized, and whose voices are excluded entirely.

Through the Dignity Lens, Power Structures analysis reveals:

- **How systematic exclusion operates** through formal and informal mechanisms that maintain white control while appearing democratic
- **How community resistance challenges** existing arrangements while building alternative structures that demonstrate community control
- **How historical evolution** shows consistent patterns of adaptation that maintain essential functions while responding to community organizing
- **How contemporary organizing** can most effectively challenge Power Structures by building independent community power

Most importantly, Power Structures analysis shows that **community control is possible** - but it requires organizing strategies that challenge the fundamental arrangements of who gets to make decisions, not just what decisions get made.

The question isn't whether existing Power Structures will voluntarily include community voices. The question is whether communities will build sufficient independent power to force systematic change in how decisions get made.

Understanding Power Structures is the foundation for understanding how systematic racism maintains itself and how community organizing can challenge it most effectively. When communities understand who really controls decisions and how that control is maintained, they can develop strategies that build genuine power rather than just symbolic representation.
