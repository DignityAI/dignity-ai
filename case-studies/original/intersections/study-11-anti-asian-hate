### **The Violence They Don't Want Connected**

On March 16, 2021, Robert Aaron Long shot and killed eight people at three Atlanta-area massage businesses, six of them Asian women. Within hours, Cherokee County Sheriff's Captain Jay Baker explained the massacre by saying Long was having "a really bad day" and had a "sexual addiction" - humanizing the white perpetrator while erasing the systematic targeting of Asian women.

But the Atlanta shootings weren't an isolated incident of individual violence. They occurred during a 150% increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, following two years of "China virus" rhetoric that blamed Asian people for COVID-19. The same week as the Atlanta murders, a 76-year-old Asian woman was brutally attacked in San Francisco, and an Asian American family was stabbed in Texas because the attacker thought they were "Chinese and infecting people with coronavirus."

This surge in anti-Asian violence wasn't random - **it was systematic scapegoating functioning exactly as designed**. When economic and public health crises create social instability, the system deflects anger away from powerful interests toward racialized communities. Asian Americans became convenient targets for frustrations about pandemic disruption, just as they had been scapegoated during previous economic downturns.

But the community response revealed the power that divide-and-conquer strategies were designed to prevent. **Stop Asian Hate** organizing connected anti-Asian violence to systematic white supremacy while building solidarity with Black Lives Matter and other racial justice movements. Asian American organizers explicitly rejected the model minority myth that pits Asian success against Black struggle, instead building **cross-racial coalitions that challenge systematic oppression affecting all communities of color**.

This pattern - **systematic scapegoating followed by community organizing that builds cross-racial solidarity** - reveals both how immigration and racial targeting maintain white supremacy and how communities can challenge divide-and-conquer strategies while building genuine multiracial power.

Understanding immigration and anti-Asian experiences through the Dignity Lens shows how **racial targeting adapts to include different communities while maintaining essential functions**, and how **cross-racial organizing can build power sufficient to challenge systematic white supremacy**.

### **Immigration & Anti-Asian Systems Through the Dignity Lens: Four Domains of Divide-and-Conquer**

Immigration systems and anti-Asian targeting operate through the same **four interconnected domains** that maintain systematic oppression across all institutions (*Study #1: What is Systematic Racism?*). Understanding how Power Structures, Control Mechanisms, Community Resistance, and Liberation Strategies operate in immigration contexts reveals both how divide-and-conquer strategies maintain white supremacy and how communities can build cross-racial solidarity that challenges systematic oppression.

#### **POWER STRUCTURES in Immigration & Anti-Asian Systems:**

### **Historical Evolution: Anti-Asian Targeting Across Seven Eras**

Understanding contemporary anti-Asian hate requires analyzing how racial targeting of Asian Americans has evolved across the seven historical eras examined through the Dignity Lens (*Study #2: How Racism Evolved*). Each era shows how systematic oppression adapts to include different communities while maintaining essential functions of racial control and divide-and-conquer strategies.

#### **Era 1-2: Exclusion and Labor Exploitation (1850s-1910)**

### **Conclusion: From Divide-and-Conquer to Cross-Racial Liberation**

The Atlanta shootings revealed both the persistence of anti-Asian targeting and the power of cross-racial solidarity that systematic oppression was designed to prevent. When Robert Aaron Long murdered six Asian women, the system immediately worked to frame the violence as individual pathology rather than systematic targeting connected to political scapegoating and historical patterns.

But the community response - Stop Asian Hate organizing that connected anti-Asian violence to systematic white supremacy while building solidarity with Black Lives Matter and other racial justice movements - demonstrated the Liberation Strategy potential that divide-and-conquer strategies were designed to contain.

This pattern - systematic scapegoating followed by community organizing that builds cross-racial solidarity - reveals both how divide-and-conquer maintains white supremacy and how it can be challenged effectively.

Through the Dignity Lens, Immigration & Anti-Asian Hate analysis shows:

- **Anti-Asian targeting has consistently served divide-and-conquer functions** across historical eras while adapting methods to serve different systematic purposes
- **Model minority myths and scapegoating narratives** operate as sophisticated Control Mechanisms that prevent cross-racial solidarity while maintaining white supremacist power
- **Asian American communities have consistently built resistance** that challenges targeting while creating cross-racial solidarity and community organizing capacity
- **Liberation strategies that build cross-racial power** can challenge systematic white supremacy while maintaining community leadership and addressing specific community needs

Most importantly, the analysis reveals that **cross-racial solidarity is possible and necessary** - communities can build the relationships, develop the analysis, and organize the power necessary to challenge divide-and-conquer strategies while building genuine multiracial power that challenges systematic white supremacy.
The question isn't whether divide-and-conquer strategies will continue to evolve from Chinese Exclusion to COVID scapegoating. The question is whether communities will build cross-racial solidarity faster than systematic oppression can adapt to prevent unified organizing.
Understanding Immigration & Anti-Asian Hate through the Dignity Lens provides the analytical tools and strategic frameworks necessary for building cross-racial power while challenging the systematic arrangements that use anti-Asian targeting to maintain white supremacist control.
From the Chinese Exclusion Act to contemporary model minority myths, anti-Asian targeting has adapted its methods while serving essential divide-and-conquer functions. But from early labor solidarity to contemporary Stop Asian Hate organizing, community resistance has also adapted while building cumulative power for cross-racial liberation.
The path from divide-and-conquer to cross-racial liberation runs through community organizing that understands how systematic oppression uses racial targeting to prevent unified resistance, while building solidarity that respects community leadership and addresses the specific needs of all communities affected by white supremacy.
The Dignity Lens Framework was developed by the Defy Racism Collective as a tool for community organizing and political education. For more information about Immigration & Anti-Asian analysis and cross-racial organizing opportunities, visit defyracismcollective.org.
