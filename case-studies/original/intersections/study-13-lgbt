### **The Violence They Don't Want to See**

Iyanna Dior was a 16-year-old Black transgender girl when a mob of over 20 people brutally attacked her outside a Minneapolis convenience store in June 2020. The assault was filmed and shared on social media, showing adults kicking, punching, and throwing objects at her while bystanders cheered. Despite clear video evidence, no arrests were made. Police claimed they couldn't identify the attackers, even though their faces were visible in the footage.

But Iyanna's attack wasn't an isolated incident of transphobic violence. It occurred during the deadliest year on record for transgender people, with Black transgender women comprising 66% of those murdered. The same week as Iyanna's assault, two Black transgender women - Riah Milton and Dominique "Rem'mie" Fells - were killed in separate incidents. None of these cases received the media attention or police investigation that violence against cisgender white victims typically generates.

This epidemic of anti-trans violence wasn't random - **it was systematic targeting functioning exactly as designed**. Black transgender women face the intersection of anti-Black racism, transmisogyny, and systematic exclusion from employment, housing, and healthcare that forces many into survival economies criminalized by the state. When society positions Black trans women as disposable, violence against them becomes normalized and unpunished.

But the community response revealed the power that systematic marginalization was designed to contain. **Black Trans Lives Matter** organizing connected anti-transgender violence to broader systematic oppression while building community alternatives that provide safety, support, and organizing capacity. Black LGBTQ+ organizers created **community defense networks, mutual aid systems, and liberation strategies** that challenge both interpersonal violence and the systematic arrangements that make violence possible.

This pattern - **systematic targeting of Black LGBTQ+ people followed by community organizing that builds intersectional liberation strategies** - reveals both how gender and sexuality oppression compounds anti-Black racism and how communities can challenge intersectional oppression while building genuine safety and community power.

Understanding LGBTQ+ experiences through the Dignity Lens shows how **gender and sexuality oppression intersects with racial targeting to create unique forms of violence**, while community organizing has consistently created alternatives that build intersectional liberation and community power.

### **LGBTQ+ & Anti-Blackness Through the Dignity Lens: Four Domains of Intersectional Oppression**

LGBTQ+ and anti-Black systems operate through the same **four interconnected domains** that maintain systematic oppression across all institutions (*Study #1: What is Systematic Racism?*). Understanding how Power Structures, Control Mechanisms, Community Resistance, and Liberation Strategies operate at the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality reveals both how intersectional oppression maintains itself and how communities can build alternatives that serve comprehensive liberation.

#### **POWER STRUCTURES in LGBTQ+ & Anti-Blackness Systems:**

### **From Individual Acceptance to Community Liberation**

Understanding Black LGBTQ+ experiences through the Dignity Lens reveals that **genuine liberation requires challenging the fundamental framework** that treats LGBTQ+ issues as individual acceptance rather than systematic oppression requiring comprehensive community organizing and intersectional liberation.

#### **Individual Acceptance vs. Community Liberation**

**INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTANCE MODEL:** LGBTQ+ equality measured through individual acceptance, legal recognition, and integration into existing systems while maintaining those systems' oppressive functions.

**COMMUNITY LIBERATION FRAMEWORK:** LGBTQ+ organizing that builds community power while connecting to broader liberation movements and challenging systematic oppression affecting all marginalized communities.

**DIGNITY LENS ANALYSIS:**

## **Conclusion: From Criminalization to Community Liberation**

Iyanna Dior's brutal assault by a mob of over 20 people represents the deadly intersection of anti-Black racism and transmisogyny that systematic oppression uses to maintain social control. Her attack - filmed, shared on social media, yet resulting in no arrests despite clear evidence - reveals how violence against Black transgender women is normalized and unpunished by systems that benefit from maintaining existing hierarchies.

But Iyanna's survival and the community response - Black Trans Lives Matter organizing that connected anti-transgender violence to systematic oppression while building community alternatives and advocacy - demonstrates the Liberation Strategy potential that intersectional oppression was designed to prevent. Her courage and community organizing prove that intersectional liberation is both necessary and possible.

This pattern - systematic targeting of Black LGBTQ+ people followed by community organizing that builds intersectional liberation strategies - reveals both how gender and sexuality oppression compounds anti-Black racism and how it can be challenged effectively.

Through the Dignity Lens, LGBTQ+ & Anti-Blackness Intersections analysis shows:

- **Intersectional oppression creates unique forms of targeting** that compound racial discrimination with gender and sexuality oppression while requiring comprehensive organizing responses
- **Contemporary intersectional control operates through sophisticated mechanisms** including violence normalization, survival criminalization, and healthcare gatekeeping that maintain multiple hierarchies simultaneously
- **Black LGBTQ+ communities have consistently built resistance** that addresses intersectional oppression while creating community-controlled alternatives to systematic exclusion and violence
- **Liberation strategies that build intersectional power** can challenge multiple forms of oppression while maintaining community leadership and building comprehensive community alternatives

Most importantly, the analysis reveals that **intersectional liberation is possible** - communities can build the relationships, develop the analysis, and organize the power necessary to challenge intersectional oppression while creating community-controlled alternatives that serve comprehensive liberation.

The question isn't whether intersectional oppression will continue to evolve its methods from historical criminalization to contemporary violence normalization. The question is whether communities will build intersectional liberation strategies faster than systematic oppression can adapt to prevent unified organizing across race, gender, and sexuality.

Understanding LGBTQ+ & Anti-Blackness Intersections through the Dignity Lens provides the analytical tools and strategic frameworks necessary for building intersectional community power while challenging the systematic arrangements that use gender and sexuality oppression to reinforce racial hierarchies.

From historical criminalization of Black gender and sexuality to contemporary anti-transgender murder epidemics, intersectional oppression has adapted its methods while maintaining essential functions of social control and community division. But from ballroom culture resistance to contemporary Black Trans Lives Matter organizing, community resistance has also adapted while building cumulative power for intersectional liberation.

The path from criminalization to community liberation runs through community organizing that understands how systematic oppression uses intersectional targeting to maintain hierarchies, while building liberation strategies that respect community leadership and address the comprehensive needs of all community members affected by intersectional oppression.

Iyanna Dior's assault was designed to send a message about the disposability of Black transgender women. But her survival and the community organizing that followed sent a different message: **Black LGBTQ+ communities will not be disappeared, and intersectional liberation is not only possible but inevitable when communities organize with comprehensive analysis and sustained commitment to community power**.

*The Dignity Lens Framework was developed by the Defy Racism Collective as a tool for community organizing and political education. For more information about LGBTQ+ & Anti-Blackness Intersections analysis and intersectional organizing opportunities, visit defyracismcollective.org.*
