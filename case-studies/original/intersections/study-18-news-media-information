## *From Propaganda to Community Journalism Through the Dignity Lens*

### **The Coverage That Revealed the System**

When 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9, 2014, mainstream media coverage immediately focused on Brown's alleged robbery of cigarillos and his size - 6'4" and nearly 300 pounds - rather than the fact that an unarmed teenager had been shot six times and left in the street for four hours.

CNN, Fox News, and other major outlets amplified police narratives about Brown being a "thug" and a "demon" while suppressing witness accounts that contradicted the official story. Photos of Brown making peace signs were replaced with images that made him appear threatening. Meanwhile, peaceful protesters were described as "rioters" while militarized police response was framed as necessary law enforcement.

But community-controlled media told a different story. Residents used Twitter, Facebook, and livestreaming to document police violence in real-time, showing tear gas attacks on peaceful protesters and journalists. Local bloggers and citizen journalists provided eyewitness accounts that contradicted official narratives. **Community-controlled information challenged the systematic media distortion designed to justify police violence**.

This pattern wasn't accidental - **it was information control functioning exactly as designed to maintain systematic oppression**. Corporate media ownership, advertising revenue models, and editorial relationships with law enforcement created systematic bias that served power while marginalizing community voices and experiences.

But Ferguson also revealed the power that media control was designed to contain. **Community-controlled information** bypassed corporate gatekeepers, built national solidarity, and created narrative frameworks that connected individual police violence to systematic oppression. Citizen journalists, community bloggers, and social media organizing demonstrated that **communities can build information systems that serve liberation rather than power**.

This pattern - **systematic media distortion followed by community organizing that builds information liberation** - reveals both how corporate media maintains systematic oppression and how communities can create media alternatives that advance community power and liberation organizing.

Understanding news media through the Dignity Lens shows how **information control evolved from explicit propaganda to corporate media consolidation to algorithmic manipulation** while community organizing has consistently created media alternatives that challenge dominant narratives and build community power.

### **News Media & Information Control Through the Dignity Lens: Four Domains of Narrative Power**

News media and information systems operate through the same **four interconnected domains** that maintain systematic oppression across all institutions (*Study #1: What is Systematic Racism?*). Understanding how Power Structures, Control Mechanisms, Community Resistance, and Liberation Strategies operate in media contexts reveals both how information oppression maintains itself and how communities can build alternatives that serve liberation rather than control.

#### **POWER STRUCTURES in News Media & Information Systems:**
*Who controls news production, distribution, and narrative framing affecting community stories and organizing?*

- **Corporate Media Ownership:** Large media conglomerates (Comcast, Disney, News Corp, ViacomCBS) that control television networks, newspapers, and digital platforms with minimal community accountability or diverse ownership
- **Advertising Revenue Control:** Corporate advertisers and marketing agencies that determine media content through revenue dependence while avoiding stories that challenge corporate interests or systematic oppression
- **Government Information Management:** Government agencies, law enforcement, and political officials that control press access, information release, and official narratives while limiting community access to decision-making information
- **Technology Platform Authority:** Social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok) that control information distribution through algorithmic content promotion and suppression with minimal community oversight
- **Journalism Education and Professional Networks:** Journalism schools, professional associations, and media industry networks that determine reporting standards while often excluding community perspectives and systematic oppression analysis
- **Legal and Regulatory Framework:** FCC regulations, media ownership rules, and press freedom laws that shape media industry structure while often protecting corporate interests over community information needs

#### **CONTROL MECHANISMS in News Media & Information Systems:**
*How are Black communities excluded from media representation and how is information used to justify systematic oppression?*

### **Conclusion: From Corporate Control to Community Information Liberation**

The Ferguson uprising revealed both the power of corporate media control and the potential of community-controlled information. When mainstream media portrayed Michael Brown as a "thug" and peaceful protesters as "rioters," they demonstrated how systematic media bias functions to justify police violence and community oppression.

But Ferguson also showed the Liberation Strategy potential that media control was designed to prevent. Community-controlled information through social media, citizen journalism, and alternative media challenged corporate narratives while building national solidarity and systematic analysis that connected individual police violence to broader patterns of oppression.

This pattern - systematic media distortion followed by community organizing that builds information liberation - reveals both how media control operates and how communities can develop information strategies that serve liberation rather than power.

Through the Dignity Lens, News Media & Information Control analysis shows:

- **Media systems have consistently excluded community voices** while adapting from explicit propaganda to corporate consolidation to algorithmic manipulation that maintains essential functions of narrative control and organizing suppression
- **Contemporary media oppression operates through sophisticated mechanisms** including corporate ownership concentration, source selection bias, and social media algorithmic suppression that maintain information inequality while providing professional journalism justification
- **Community resistance has always developed media alternatives** that challenge dominant narratives while building community information capacity rather than just individual access to corporate media platforms
- **Liberation strategies that build community media power** can challenge information oppression while creating community-controlled alternatives that serve comprehensive liberation organizing

Most importantly, the analysis reveals that **community-controlled media is possible** - communities can build the journalism capacity, develop the information infrastructure, and organize the power necessary to transform media systems from corporate control into community information liberation.

The question isn't whether media control will continue to evolve from newspaper propaganda to algorithmic suppression. The question is whether communities will build information liberation alternatives faster than media systems can adapt to contain community narrative power.

Understanding News Media & Information Control through the Dignity Lens provides the analytical tools and strategic frameworks necessary for building community media power while challenging the systematic arrangements that use information control to justify systematic oppression and prevent community organizing.

From historical propaganda to contemporary corporate consolidation, media control has adapted its methods while maintaining essential functions of narrative power and organizing suppression. But from early Black press to contemporary community digital media, community resistance has also adapted while building cumulative information capacity for community-controlled liberation.

The path from corporate control to community information liberation runs through community organizing that understands systematic media oppression while building community-controlled alternatives that serve liberation rather than power and profit.
