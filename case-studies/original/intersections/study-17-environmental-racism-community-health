### **The Water That Poisoned a City**

LeeAnne Walters noticed the rash on her children's skin in January 2014, just months after Flint, Michigan switched its water source to the Flint River to save money. Her 4-year-old son's hair was falling out, and her twin boys developed mysterious illnesses. When she tested her tap water, it contained 13,200 parts per billion of lead - nearly 900 times the federal action level.

But city officials insisted the water was safe. They told residents that discolored, foul-smelling water was normal and that health problems were unrelated to the water supply. It took Walters partnering with EPA scientist Marc Edwards and pediatrician Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha to prove what residents already knew: **their government was systematically poisoning them**.

The Flint water crisis wasn't an accident - **it was environmental racism functioning exactly as designed**. City officials, appointed by Michigan's Emergency Manager law, chose to save money by switching to a corrosive water source without proper treatment, knowing it would damage the pipes in a majority-Black city. When residents complained, officials dismissed their concerns and covered up evidence of lead contamination.

But LeeAnne Walters' resistance also revealed the power that environmental oppression was designed to contain. Her organizing with other Flint mothers sparked **national environmental justice organizing** that connected local water contamination to systematic patterns of toxic exposure in Black communities. Their work exposed how environmental racism operates through government policy while building **community-controlled alternatives** that put resident knowledge and organizing at the center of environmental health solutions.

This pattern - **systematic toxic exposure followed by community organizing that builds environmental justice and community power** - reveals both how environmental systems target Black communities for toxic harm and how communities can challenge environmental oppression while building genuine environmental health and community control.

Understanding environmental racism through the Dignity Lens shows how **toxic placement evolved from industrial segregation to contemporary environmental sacrifice zones** while community organizing has consistently created environmental alternatives that advance liberation and community health.

### **Environmental Racism Through the Dignity Lens: Four Domains of Toxic Control**

Environmental racism operates through the same **four interconnected domains** that maintain systematic oppression across all institutions (*Study #1: What is Systematic Racism?*). Understanding how Power Structures, Control Mechanisms, Community Resistance, and Liberation Strategies operate in environmental contexts reveals both how environmental oppression maintains itself and how communities can build alternatives that serve environmental liberation and community health.

#### **POWER STRUCTURES in Environmental Racism Systems:**
*Who controls environmental policy, industrial placement, and resource allocation decisions affecting community environmental health?*

- **Corporate Environmental Control:** Chemical companies, oil refineries, waste management corporations, and industrial facilities that determine toxic facility placement with minimal community input or accountability
- **Government Environmental Policy:** EPA, state environmental agencies, and local zoning boards that regulate environmental health while often prioritizing economic development over community environmental protection
- **Land Use and Zoning Authority:** City planning departments and zoning boards that determine industrial placement and residential development while excluding community voices from environmental land use decisions

### **From Individual Environmental Health to Community Environmental Justice**

Understanding environmental racism through the Dignity Lens reveals that **genuine environmental justice requires challenging the fundamental framework** that treats environmental health as individual exposure problem rather than systematic oppression requiring community control over environmental policy and community-controlled environmental alternatives.

#### **Individual Environmental Health vs. Community Environmental Justice**

**INDIVIDUAL HEALTH MODEL:** Environmental health focused on individual exposure reduction and medical treatment while maintaining corporate and government control over environmental policy and toxic facility placement.

**COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE:** Environmental organizing that builds both individual environmental health protection and community control over environmental policy while connecting environmental health to broader systematic oppression and liberation organizing.

**DIGNITY LENS ANALYSIS:**

### **Conclusion: From Toxic Exposure to Community Environmental Control**

LeeAnne Walters' discovery of lead poisoning in Flint's water represents the deadly sophistication of environmental racism designed to sacrifice Black communities for corporate profit and government cost-cutting. The systematic poisoning of an entire city revealed how environmental oppression operates through official denial and cover-up while communities experience the health consequences of systematic toxic exposure.

But the Flint mothers' response - organizing with scientists and doctors to prove government poisoning while building national environmental justice organizing - also demonstrated the Liberation Strategy potential that environmental oppression was designed to prevent. Their work exposed systematic environmental racism while building community-controlled environmental monitoring and advocacy that continues today.

This pattern - systematic toxic exposure followed by community organizing that builds environmental justice and community power - reveals both how environmental racism operates and how communities can develop environmental strategies that serve liberation rather than just environmental protection.

Through the Dignity Lens, Environmental Racism & Community Health analysis shows:

- **Environmental systems have consistently targeted Black communities for toxic exposure** while providing environmental protection for white communities through systematic toxic facility placement and environmental resource allocation
- **Contemporary environmental racism operates through sophisticated mechanisms** including industrial facility concentration, environmental health disparities, and climate change disproportionate impacts that maintain environmental inequality while providing environmental justification
- **Community resistance has always developed environmental alternatives** that address environmental health while building community environmental organizing capacity rather than just individual environmental health protection
- **Liberation strategies that build community environmental power** can challenge environmental oppression while creating community-controlled alternatives that serve comprehensive environmental liberation

Most importantly, the analysis reveals that **community environmental control is possible** - communities can build the environmental knowledge, develop the environmental alternatives, and organize the power necessary to transform environmental systems from toxic exposure into community environmental liberation.

The question isn't whether environmental racism will continue to evolve from industrial segregation to climate change disproportionate impacts. The question is whether communities will build environmental liberation alternatives faster than environmental systems can adapt to contain community environmental power.

Understanding Environmental Racism & Community Health through the Dignity Lens provides the analytical tools and strategic frameworks necessary for building community environmental power while challenging the systematic arrangements that use toxic exposure to maintain environmental inequality and prevent community environmental control.

From industrial toxic placement to contemporary climate vulnerability, environmental racism has adapted its methods while maintaining essential functions of community toxic exposure and environmental resource extraction. But from community environmental monitoring to contemporary climate justice organizing, community resistance has also adapted while building cumulative environmental capacity for community-controlled environmental liberation.

The path from toxic exposure to community environmental control runs through community organizing that understands systematic environmental oppression while building community-controlled alternatives that serve environmental liberation rather than environmental protection that maintains corporate and government environmental control.
