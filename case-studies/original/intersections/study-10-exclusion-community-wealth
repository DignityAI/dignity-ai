# **STUDY #10: ECONOMIC EXCLUSION & COMMUNITY WEALTH BUILDING**
## *From Slavery to Wealth Gaps Through the Dignity Lens*

---

### **The Loan They Won't Approve**

In 2019, Charles and Te-Erika Patterson, a Black couple from Richmond, Virginia, applied for a mortgage to refinance their home. Despite having excellent credit scores above 700 and a combined income of over $90,000, their loan application was rejected by Freedom Mortgage Corporation. The company claimed their debt-to-income ratio was too high, despite the fact that their existing mortgage payments were higher than the proposed new payments.

When a white couple with similar financial profiles applied to the same lender during a fair housing test, they were immediately pre-approved and offered additional loan products. The Pattersons' case became part of a Department of Justice lawsuit that resulted in a $1.33 million settlement in 2022, after the company was found to have systematically discriminated against Black and Latino borrowers.

This wasn't individual prejudice - **it was systematic economic exclusion functioning exactly as designed**. Recent Federal Reserve data shows that Black applicants are denied conventional mortgage loans at rates 84% higher than white applicants, even when controlling for income, credit score, and loan amount. In 2021, only 2.4% of conventional home purchase loans went to Black borrowers, despite Black Americans comprising 13.4% of the population.

But the Pattersons' story also revealed the power that economic exclusion was designed to contain. Rather than accepting rejection quietly, they connected with **National Fair Housing Alliance** investigators who documented the discriminatory lending patterns. Their case helped expose systematic mortgage discrimination while building legal precedent for community-controlled banking alternatives.

This pattern - **systematic economic exclusion followed by community organizing that builds alternative wealth-building strategies** - reveals both how economic systems maintain racial inequality and how communities can challenge economic oppression while building genuine community wealth and power.

Understanding economic systems through the Dignity Lens shows how **wealth exclusion has evolved from slavery's unpaid labor to contemporary financial discrimination**, while community organizing has consistently created economic alternatives that build community wealth and organizing capacity.

### **Economic Systems Through the Dignity Lens: Four Domains of Wealth Control**

Economic systems operate through the same **four interconnected domains** that maintain systematic oppression across all institutions (*Study #1: What is Systematic Racism?*). Understanding how Power Structures, Control Mechanisms, Community Resistance, and Liberation Strategies operate in economic contexts reveals both how wealth exclusion maintains itself and how communities can build alternatives that serve economic liberation and community power.

#### **POWER STRUCTURES in Economic Systems:**
*Who controls employment, lending, business development, and resource allocation decisions?*

- **Corporate Leadership:** CEOs and boards of major employers, banks, and businesses that control hiring, lending, and economic development decisions affecting community wealth building
- **Financial Institution Governance:** Leadership of banks, credit unions, and investment firms that determine access to capital, mortgages, and business loans through lending policies and risk assessment
- **Real Estate and Development Power:** Property owners, developers, and real estate investment trusts that control land use, community investment priorities, and displacement patterns through development decisions
- **Government Economic Policy:** Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, and local economic development authorities that make policy decisions affecting taxation, business regulation, and community development funding
- **Labor Market Control:** Corporate HR departments, hiring managers, and union leadership that determine wages, working conditions, and employment opportunities through workplace policies
- **Investment and Ownership Networks:** Institutional investors, private equity firms, and venture capital that shape business development and community economic opportunities through capital allocation

#### **CONTROL MECHANISMS in Economic Systems:**
*How are Black communities excluded from wealth building and economic opportunities?*

- **Employment Discrimination:** Systematic hiring bias that results in Black job applicants receiving 36% fewer callbacks than white applicants with identical resumes, according to recent meta-analysis studies
- **Financial Services Redlining:** Banking practices where Black applicants are 84% more likely to be denied conventional mortgages and pay average of 7.9 basis points higher interest rates when approved
- **Business Development Barriers:** Black-owned businesses receiving only 1.8% of Small Business Administration loans despite representing 9.4% of all businesses, with average loan amounts 35% smaller than white-owned businesses
- **Housing and Real Estate Exclusion:** Systematic appraisal bias that undervalues homes in Black neighborhoods by average of $48,000, reducing homeowner equity and community wealth accumulation
- **Educational and Skill Development Limitations:** Restricted access to job training programs and professional development, with Black workers underrepresented in high-paying STEM fields despite similar educational attainment
- **Criminal Justice Economic Punishment:** Employment background checks affecting 27% of U.S. adults with criminal records, disproportionately impacting Black workers and creating permanent economic barriers

#### **COMMUNITY RESISTANCE in Economic Systems:**
*How do Black communities fight for economic opportunities and wealth building?*

- **Labor Organizing and Union Building:** Workplace organizing including Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, and McDonald's Fight for $15 campaigns that demand fair wages while building community economic power
- **Community Development and Investment:** Neighborhood organizing like Detroit's East Warren/Cadieux Community Development Corporation that attracts investment while preventing displacement through community-controlled development
- **Cooperative Economics:** Worker-owned businesses including Cooperation Jackson in Mississippi and Evergreen Cooperatives in Cleveland that keep wealth in community through democratic ownership
- **Financial Justice Advocacy:** Organizations like National Community Reinvestment Coalition documenting discriminatory lending while building community-controlled financial institutions
- **Business Development Support:** Programs like Operation HOPE providing capital and training for Black entrepreneurs while building networks for sustainable business development
- **Economic Policy Advocacy:** Legislative campaigns for living wages, banking regulation, and community development that address systematic economic exclusion

#### **LIBERATION STRATEGIES in Economic Systems:**
*What has actually worked to build Black wealth and community economic power?*

- **Community-Controlled Financial Institutions:** Credit unions like Self-Help Federal Credit Union serving 140,000+ members with $2.8 billion in assets, prioritizing community development over profit maximization
- **Cooperative and Social Economy:** Successful models like Cooperative Home Care Associates in New York employing 2,300+ worker-owners and demonstrating large-scale cooperative development
- **Community Land and Real Estate Control:** Community land trusts like Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative in Boston controlling 225+ housing units and preventing displacement through community ownership
- **Community-Controlled Business Development:** Small Business Administration Community Advantage loans and New Markets Tax Credits financing $90+ billion in community development since 2000
- **Economic Policy Victories That Build Community Power:** Community Reinvestment Act resulting in $2.5+ trillion in community development commitments since 1977, though enforcement remains inconsistent
- **Cross-Sector Economic Organizing:** Coordinated campaigns like Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy connecting employment, housing, and business development to build comprehensive community economic power

### **From Individual Advancement to Community Wealth Building**

Understanding economic systems through the Dignity Lens reveals that **genuine economic justice requires challenging the fundamental framework** that treats economic success as individual advancement rather than community wealth building and economic democracy.

#### **Individual Economic Mobility vs. Community Wealth Building**

**INDIVIDUAL MOBILITY MODEL:** Economic success measured through individual income, homeownership, and asset accumulation with minimal connection to community economic development or organizing capacity.

**COMMUNITY WEALTH BUILDING:** Economic development that builds both individual economic security and community ownership of productive assets while connecting economic success to community empowerment and systematic change.

**MEASURED DIFFERENCES:**
- **Individual focus:** Black median household income increased 35% (1970-2020) but wealth gap expanded
- **Community approach:** Areas with community land trusts show 60% less displacement during gentrification
- **Cooperative enterprises:** Worker-owners earn average 70% higher wages than comparable traditional employees

### **Connections Across the Dignity Lens Framework**

Understanding Economic Exclusion & Community Wealth Building connects directly to other domains and studies in the Dignity Lens framework:

- **How Power Structures in economics** maintain systematic exclusion of community voices from economic decision-making and resource allocation (*Study #3: Power Structures Domain*)

- **How Control Mechanisms in economics** systematically limit Black wealth building while maintaining appearance of market-based opportunity (*Study #4: Control Mechanisms Domain*)

- **How Community Resistance and Liberation Strategies** challenge economic exclusion while building community-controlled alternatives to capitalist exploitation (*Study #5: Community Resistance & Liberation Strategies*)

The Economic Exclusion analysis also connects to other institutional applications of the Dignity Lens:

- **Housing discrimination** that prevents Black homeownership and wealth building while maintaining residential segregation
- **Educational inequality** that limits economic opportunities through restricted access to job training and higher education (*Study #9: Education & School-to-Prison Pipeline*)
- **Legal system oppression** that creates permanent economic barriers through criminal background checks and employment restrictions (*Study #7: Legal System & Mass Incarceration*)

### **Conclusion: From Economic Exclusion to Community Wealth**

The Patterson family's mortgage discrimination case represents the continuation of systematic economic exclusion from slavery's unpaid labor to contemporary lending bias. Their experience reveals how economic systems continue to function as mechanisms for preventing Black wealth building while maintaining legal justification for disparate outcomes.

But their organizing response - working with fair housing advocates to expose discriminatory lending while building legal precedent for community economic alternatives - demonstrates the Liberation Strategy potential that economic exclusion was designed to prevent. Their case proved that communities can challenge systematic economic oppression while building alternatives that serve community wealth building.

Through the Dignity Lens, Economic Exclusion & Community Wealth Building analysis shows:

- **Economic systems have consistently extracted Black labor while preventing Black wealth accumulation** across all historical eras through evolving methods that maintain essential functions
- **Contemporary economic exclusion operates through measurable mechanisms** including an 84% higher mortgage denial rate, 6.3x wealth gap, and systematic workplace discrimination
- **Community resistance has developed quantifiable alternatives** including 1,100+ community development financial institutions, 400+ worker cooperatives, and 260+ community land trusts
- **Liberation strategies that build community power** can transform economic systems from wealth extraction into community wealth building that serves organizing and systematic change

The question isn't whether economic exclusion will continue - current Federal Reserve data shows wealth gaps expanding despite civil rights law. The question is whether communities will build wealth-building alternatives faster than economic systems can adapt to contain community economic power.

Understanding Economic Exclusion & Community Wealth Building through the Dignity Lens provides the analytical tools and strategic frameworks necessary for building community economic power while challenging the systematic arrangements that maintain wealth concentration and economic inequality.
