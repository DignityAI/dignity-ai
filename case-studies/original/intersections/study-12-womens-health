### **The Surgery She Never Consented To**

Fannie Lou Hamer went to the hospital in 1961 to have a small uterine tumor removed. She was 44 years old, a sharecropper and civil rights organizer in rural Mississippi. When she woke up from surgery, she discovered that doctors had performed a complete hysterectomy without her knowledge or consent. She later learned this happened to so many Black women in the South that it was called a "Mississippi appendectomy."

"I went to the doctor who did that to me and I asked him, 'Why? Why had he done that to me?' He didn't have to say nothing - and he didn't," Hamer recalled. But she understood why. **It was systematic reproductive control designed to prevent Black women from having children and building families that could challenge white supremacy**.

Fannie Lou Hamer's forced sterilization wasn't medical malpractice - **it was reproductive oppression functioning exactly as designed**. Between 1907 and 1963, over 65,000 Americans were sterilized against their will, with Black women, poor women, and disabled women targeted at disproportionate rates. The same medical system that claimed to protect women's health was systematically controlling Black women's reproductive capacity.

But Fannie Lou Hamer's response revealed the power that reproductive oppression was designed to contain. She didn't suffer in silence - she testified about her forced sterilization at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, connecting reproductive violence to systematic racism and civil rights organizing. Her courage helped expose systematic reproductive abuse while building community organizing that challenged both reproductive oppression and broader systematic inequality.

This pattern - **systematic reproductive control followed by community organizing that builds reproductive justice and community power** - reveals both how reproductive systems maintain racial inequality and how communities can challenge reproductive oppression while building genuine reproductive freedom and community control.

Understanding reproductive systems through the Dignity Lens shows how **reproductive control has evolved from slavery's forced breeding to contemporary reproductive restrictions**, while community organizing has consistently created reproductive alternatives that build community power and organizing capacity.

### **Historical Evolution: Reproductive Control Across Seven Eras**

Understanding contemporary reproductive restrictions requires analyzing how reproductive control has evolved across the seven historical eras examined through the Dignity Lens (*Study #2: How Racism Evolved*). Each era shows how reproductive systems have adapted their methods while maintaining the essential function of controlling Black women's reproductive capacity and preventing community organizing that could challenge systematic inequality.

#### **Era 1-2: Slavery and Reproductive Exploitation (1600s-1910)**

**POWER STRUCTURES:** Reproductive systems controlled exclusively by white men with direct economic interests in controlling Black women's reproductive capacity for plantation labor and wealth accumulation.

### **Contemporary Reproductive Oppression: How Reproductive Control Maintains Inequality**

Modern reproductive oppression operates through sophisticated mechanisms that control Black women's reproductive autonomy while providing legal and medical justification for reproductive restrictions. Understanding these contemporary patterns through the Dignity Lens reveals both how reproductive oppression operates and how communities can challenge it effectively.

#### **Maternal Mortality and Healthcare Disparities**

**THE PATTERN:** Black women die from pregnancy-related causes at rates 3-4 times higher than white women, with mortality rates that have worsened over time despite overall improvements in maternal healthcare technology and medical knowledge.

### **From Individual Reproductive Rights to Community Reproductive Justice**

Understanding reproductive systems through the Dignity Lens reveals that **genuine reproductive freedom requires challenging the fundamental framework** that treats reproduction as individual choice rather than community issue requiring community control over reproductive healthcare and policy.

#### **Individual Reproductive Rights vs. Community Reproductive Justice**

**INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS MODEL:** Reproductive freedom measured through individual access to contraception and abortion while maintaining professional and institutional control over reproductive healthcare and policy.

**COMMUNITY REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE:** Reproductive freedom that builds both individual reproductive autonomy and community control over reproductive healthcare policy and resource allocation while connecting reproductive issues to broader community organizing.

**DIGNITY LENS ANALYSIS:**
- **Power Structures:** Community control over reproductive healthcare priorities and policy rather than professional or corporate control over reproductive decision-making
- **Control Mechanisms:** Challenging systematic barriers to reproductive autonomy rather than just providing access to existing reproductive healthcare systems that may perpetuate oppression
- **Community Resistance:** Building community capacity for reproductive alternatives rather than depending on reproductive healthcare institutions that may not serve community needs
- **Liberation Strategies:** Creating community-controlled reproductive approaches that serve community organizing while building comprehensive reproductive freedom

#### **Reproductive Healthcare vs. Community Reproductive Wellness**

**REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE MODEL:** Medical treatment for reproductive health issues while maintaining professional control over reproductive healthcare delivery and limited community input in reproductive health policy and service priorities.

**COMMUNITY REPRODUCTIVE WELLNESS:** Reproductive health as community issue that requires community control over reproductive health resources and comprehensive approaches that address systematic causes of reproductive health disparities.

**COMMUNITY ORGANIZING APPLICATIONS:**
- **Community Reproductive Health as Community Organizing:** Connecting reproductive health advocacy to broader community organizing around housing, economic justice, environmental health, and political participation

### **Connections Across the Dignity Lens Framework**

Understanding Women's Health & Reproductive Justice connects directly to other domains and studies in the Dignity Lens framework:

- **How Power Structures in reproductive healthcare** maintain systematic exclusion of community voices from reproductive healthcare decision-making and policy development (*Study #3: Power Structures Domain*)

- **How Control Mechanisms in reproductive systems** systematically control Black women's reproductive autonomy while denying community-controlled reproductive healthcare alternatives (*Study #4: Control Mechanisms Domain*)

- **How Community Resistance and Liberation Strategies** challenge reproductive oppression while building community-controlled alternatives to reproductive control and healthcare inequality (*Study #5: Community Resistance & Liberation Strategies*)

- **How reproductive oppression has evolved across seven historical eras** to maintain essential functions while adapting to reproductive rights victories and community organizing (*Study #2: How Racism Evolved*)

The Women's Health & Reproductive Justice analysis also connects to other institutional applications of the Dignity Lens:

- **Medical racism** that affects all aspects of Black women's healthcare while limiting community control over health policy and resource allocation (*Medical Racism & Community Health*)
- **Economic exclusion** that limits access to reproductive healthcare through insurance and cost barriers while preventing community-controlled reproductive healthcare development (*Economic Exclusion & Community Wealth Building*)
- **Legal system oppression** that criminalizes reproductive healthcare decisions while protecting reproductive healthcare providers who discriminate against Black women (*Legal System & Mass Incarceration*)
- **Environmental racism** that creates reproductive health hazards through toxic exposure while limiting community control over environmental health policy (*Environmental Racism & Community Health*)

### **Conclusion: From Forced Sterilization to Community-Controlled Reproductive Healthcare**

Fannie Lou Hamer's forced sterilization represents the continuation of reproductive oppression from slavery's forced breeding to contemporary reproductive control. Her experience reveals how reproductive systems continue to function as mechanisms for controlling Black women's bodies while preventing community organizing that could challenge systematic inequality.

But Fannie Lou Hamer's organizing response - testifying about reproductive violence while building civil rights organizing that connected reproductive oppression to broader systematic inequality - demonstrates the Liberation Strategy potential that reproductive oppression was designed to prevent. Her courage proved that communities can challenge systematic reproductive oppression while building alternatives that serve reproductive freedom.

This pattern - systematic reproductive control followed by community organizing that builds reproductive justice - reveals both how reproductive oppression operates and how it can be challenged effectively.

Through the Dignity Lens, Women's Health & Reproductive Justice analysis shows:

- **Reproductive systems have consistently controlled Black women's reproductive capacity** while adapting methods across historical eras to maintain essential functions of reproductive control and community organizing prevention
- **Contemporary reproductive oppression operates through sophisticated mechanisms** including maternal mortality, contraceptive coercion, and reproductive criminalization that maintain reproductive control while providing medical and legal justification for disparate outcomes

Community resistance has always developed alternative approaches to reproductive healthcare through community-controlled birth support, reproductive justice organizing, and comprehensive reproductive health advocacy
Liberation strategies that build community power can transform reproductive systems from reproductive control into community-controlled reproductive healthcare that serves reproductive freedom and community organizing

Most importantly, the analysis reveals that community-controlled reproductive healthcare is possible - communities can build the knowledge, develop the resources, and organize the power necessary to transform reproductive systems from systematic oppression into systematic liberation.
The question isn't whether reproductive oppression will continue to evolve its methods from forced sterilization to contemporary reproductive restrictions. The question is whether communities will build reproductive alternatives faster than reproductive systems can adapt to contain community reproductive power.
Understanding Women's Health & Reproductive Justice through the Dignity Lens provides the analytical tools and strategic frameworks necessary for building community reproductive power while challenging the systematic arrangements that control Black women's reproductive autonomy.
From slavery's forced breeding to contemporary reproductive criminalization, reproductive oppression has adapted its methods while maintaining essential functions. But from traditional midwifery networks to contemporary birth justice organizing, community resistance has also adapted while building cumulative power for community-controlled reproductive healthcare.
The path from forced sterilization to community-controlled reproductive healthcare runs through community organizing that understands systematic oppression while building community-controlled alternatives that serve reproductive liberation rather than reproductive control.
The Dignity Lens Framework was developed by the Defy Racism Collective as a tool for community organizing and political education. For more information about Women's Health & Reproductive Justice analysis and reproductive justice organizing opportunities, visit defyracismcollective.org.
